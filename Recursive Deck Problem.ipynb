    "A few days ago my friend Cooper asked me what I thought was the expected outcome for the number of cards being in the right position in a shuffled standard deck of cards. For example, if only one card was in the right place, the deck would have a value of one. He had written an algorithm that determine this value experimentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem, I tried to find the number of combinations that had a value of n. This meant the some combination of n cards were in the right spot, and all other cards were in the wrong spot. The key to using this method was correctly calculating the number of ways to arrange the remaining cards such that they are all in the wrong place. At first I thought that the only way all cards could be out of order was by rotating the correct order but I realized this was not the case for sequences longer than 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it dawned on me that the number of completely out of order sequences is the number of total sequences minus the  number of sequences with some positive number of elements in the correct spot. For example, the number of 15 element sequences that are completely out of order is equal to the total number of 15 element sequences (15!) minus the number of sequences with 1 element in the right spot, 2 elements in the right spot and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with the example of 15, we see that there are 15 choose 1 ways to pick 1 correct element. This means that the remaining 14 elements MUST all be out of place. By ignoring the one element in the correct spot, we see that we just need to know how many 14 element sequences there are where no elements are in the right spot. We don't have a method for finding this number quite yet but we shall return. We will then look at the next case. With 2 spots, there are 15 choose 2 ways to pick 2 spots to fix and the other 13 must all be in the wrong place as with the 1 spot case. Again we need to find the number of sequences with 13 spots completely out of order. It is clear that for any j number of spots, we can fix j elements in 15 choose j ways and we need to find the number of 15-j element sequences that are completely out of order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the pattern we see that the number of completely incorrect sequences of n elements can be derived from the number of completely incorrect sequences for each number of elements less than n. In other words, the number of completely incorrect sequences is recursive."

    "While trying to answer this problem, I started looking in permutations and combinations. At first, I used the shuffle function from the random library to generate possible sequences. Each new sequence was added to a master list. The random generation process would continue until n! unique sequences of n elements were created. While considering the above problem, I realized this can also be done using recursion to ensure that all n! sequences are found systematically. By choosing one element as the first value, we are left with n-1 elements. There are (n-1)! ways to order these elements. We can use the previously found permutations for n-1 elements by utilizing arrays as indices. It should be noted that there are n such elements which can be assigned the first slot, therefore there are n times (n-1)! or n! permutations. I defined the function such that if an integer x where passed in, the program would find permutations for all integers less than n if they were not already available. Once this was done, it would be possible to find all permutations of length x.\n"
